/**
 * Registration Attempt Recovery Email Template
 *
 * Sent when someone attempts to register a new account using an email address
 * that already belongs to an existing account (issue #1406, account-enumeration
 * hardening on the registration form). It notifies the existing account holder
 * and offers a password reset, rather than revealing to the person attempting
 * registration that the email is already in use.
 *
 * Rendered via ElanRegistry\RegistrationRecoveryNotifier::notifyIfAccountExists().
 * The reset link intentionally targets the existing password-reset verification
 * flow (users/forgot_password_reset.php) — no new endpoint is introduced.
 *
 * Variables available (from $email_field_whitelist):
 *   $fname            — user's first name (raw)
 *   $email            — already rawurlencode'd by the caller; do NOT re-encode in this template
 *   $vericode         — raw plaintext token (rawurlencode applied in this template)
 *   $user_id          — user ID integer
 *   $reset_vericode_expiry — reset link expiry in minutes
