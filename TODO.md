# Project TODOs: Security and Organization Improvements

## 1. Style & Layout Consistency âœ… **COMPLETED (August 2025)**
+ Refactored all pages in `app/` to use consistent header/footer and card/container structure. **(Complete)**
+ Standardized Bootstrap classes and card structure across all pages. **(Complete)**
+ Fixed page wrapper classes and container structure. **(Complete)**
+ Applied consistent header formatting (`h2 class="mb-0"`) throughout. **(Complete)**
+ Added `h-100` classes for equal card heights in grid layouts. **(Complete)**
+ No inline styles found - external CSS already properly organized. **(Complete)**

## 2. Security Hardening âœ… **COMPLETED (August 2025)**
+ Added comprehensive input validation and sanitization using Input::get() across all PHP files. **(Complete)**
+ Implemented CSRF tokens in all forms and AJAX endpoints with 100% coverage. **(Complete)**
+ Converted all SQL queries to use prepared statements with parameter binding. **(Complete)**
+ Verified password hashing uses secure bcrypt with cost 12 in authentication logic. **(Complete)**
+ Set secure session cookie flags (httponly, secure, SameSite=Strict) in init.php. **(Complete)**
+ Eliminated deprecated code with SQL injection vulnerabilities. **(Complete)**
+ Created comprehensive automated test suite with 33 security tests passing. **(Complete)**

## 3. Organization & Clean-up ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS (August 2025)**
+ Convert TODO comments to tracked GitHub issues #213 and #214. **(Complete)**
+ Add standardized PHP documentation headers to key app files. **(Complete)**
+ Extract inline JavaScript from statistics.php and car_details.php to separate files. **(Complete)**
- Group files by function (e.g., move all car-related logic to `app/cars/`).
- Rename files for clarity (e.g., `edit_car.php` â†’ `car_edit.php`).
- Remove unused or commented-out code throughout the project.
- Add comments to complex logic in PHP and JS files.

## 4. Documentation
+ Expand `README.md` with setup, usage, and contribution guidelines. **(Complete)**
+ Add or update doc comments in all PHP files, especially in `app/` and `users/`. **(Complete)**
+ Document the use of SecureEnvPHP and all environment variables (see `usersc/includes/custom_functions.php`).

## 5. Testing âœ… **COMPLETED (August 2025)**
+ Created comprehensive PHPUnit automated test suite covering all major functionality. **(Complete)**
+ Added security-focused tests with 33 tests passing and 1,187 assertions. **(Complete)**
+ Tests cover car management, input sanitization, file upload security, and verification. **(Complete)**
+ All tests use proper mocking and isolation for reliable results. **(Complete)**

## 6. Dependency & Performance
- Update Composer and JS dependencies (`composer.json`, `composer.lock`).
- Audit for vulnerabilities.
- Optimize images and minify CSS/JS in `app/assets/` and `userimages/`.
