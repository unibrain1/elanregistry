/**
 * End-to-end test for the user deletion → car reassignment flow.
 *
 * Verifies that after_user_deletion.php correctly reassigns cars.user_id to
 * the noowner account when a user is deleted, without relying on any FK
 * constraint to do the work; that it deletes the user's profile row and
 * expires their pending transfer requests in the same transaction; and that
 * it logs the reassignment (one completion summary plus one entry per car).
 *
 * This test closes the gap that allowed the #1279 race condition to reach
 * production: the previous FK test exercised the constraint in isolation
 * (bypassing the hook), so the hook was never tested end-to-end.
 *
 * Extends TransferIntegrationTestCase (not IntegrationTestCase directly) solely
 * to reuse its createTransferRequest() fixture helper for the pending-transfer-
 * expiry assertions below — this file is otherwise unrelated to transfer tests.
