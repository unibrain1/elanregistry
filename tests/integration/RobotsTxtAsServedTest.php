/**
 * As-served robots.txt verification for Issue #1542.
 *
 * `tests/unit/system/RobotsTxtPolicyTest.php` reads the repo's own
 * `robots.txt` file and nothing else. That makes it structurally blind to an
 * edge/CDN layer (Cloudflare, in our case) injecting an *additional*
 * `User-agent` group into the response before it reaches a real crawler —
 * the file on disk is still correct, but the policy actually in force is not.
 * That blind spot has already produced two real bugs:
 *
 * - **#1537**: Cloudflare injected a second `User-agent: *` group carrying
 *   `Allow: /` alongside our `Disallow: /` on test.elanregistry.org. Both
 *   rules match `/` at prefix length 1 — an exact tie — and Google's
 *   documented "least restrictive wins" tie-break picks `Allow: /`. The
 *   intended blanket block on the Test host was never actually in effect.
 * - **#1541**: Cloudflare injected `Disallow: /` for 9 AI-bot tokens on
 *   production. Our own AI-bot group carries `Allow: /docs/` for those same
 *   tokens — not a tie, a strictly longer (more specific) prefix match — so
 *   plain RFC 9309 longest-prefix-match hands the win to our `Allow`,
 *   silently overriding Cloudflare's block.
 *
 * Both issues were closed by turning **off** Cloudflare's "Managed
 * robots.txt" dashboard toggle — a manual, out-of-repo setting that no code
 * review, diff, or CI check can observe. `robots.txt` and `robots-test.txt`
 * are structurally unchanged and still carry the exact shapes that produced
 * both bugs, so the risk is dormant, not eliminated. #1541's closing comment
 * asked for this test specifically, to catch a future re-enable of that
 * toggle (or any equivalent edge-injection feature, from any vendor).
 *
 * Design notes:
 *
 * - **Why test.elanregistry.org, not production.** Cloudflare's "Managed
 *   robots.txt" is a single per-zone toggle (per #1541's postmortem) — a
 *   re-enable hits both hosts at once, so the Test host is not a narrower
 *   check, it is a strictly more sensitive canary for the same event: its
 *   entire crawler policy is one blanket `Disallow: /` (`robots-test.txt`,
 *   swapped over `robots.txt` by `scripts/server-hooks/post-receive` on
 *   every Test deploy), so any injected group is both maximally consequential
 *   — the un-authenticated Test site relies solely on that block to stay
 *   unindexed — and trivially detectable against three expected lines.
 *   Residual gap: Cloudflare's AI Crawl Control can in principle be scoped
 *   per hostname, so a production-only re-enable would leave this test green
 *   while #1541 recurred verbatim on the host it originally affected. This
 *   test does not fetch production; closing that gap would mean adding a
 *   second live fetch against `elanregistry.org` / `PRODUCTION_ROBOTS_FILE`.
 * - **Why a live fetch and not a fixture.** A dashboard toggle has no
 *   observable artifact in this repo; fetching the real response is the only
 *   way to see its effect. A checked-in "what Cloudflare injects" fixture
 *   would be frozen at whatever that vendor shipped on the day it was
 *   written and would drift silently.
 * - **Why `tests/integration/`.** This test needs outbound network access,
 *   so it must never run in CI, `composer test:quick`, or
 *   `composer test:medium`. Directory placement alone achieves that (the
 *   tiers are directory-scoped) — no group-based CI exclusion is required.
 *   It *is* picked up by `composer test:integration` and `composer test:full`,
 *   which run the whole `tests/integration` directory: a live outbound HTTPS
 *   request to test.elanregistry.org is expected and accepted in those two
 *   suites specifically. Both can therefore report red for environmental
 *   reasons — most commonly the Test host being unreachable, or a local
 *   `robots-test.txt` edit that has not been deployed there yet. The
 *   live-fetch tests skip rather than fail when the network is unavailable;
 *   the data-provider tests below run unconditionally.
 * - **Deliberate scope limit.** `foreignGroups()` compares *parsed* groups,
 *   not raw bytes. Reformatting, comment edits, or trailing-whitespace churn
 *   in `robots-test.txt` will never trip it; only a semantically distinct
 *   `User-agent` group in the served response will. That is by design — a
 *   byte-diff would be noisy enough to get muted, which is exactly how this
 *   class of bug goes unnoticed in the first place.
 * - **Not every red run here is edge injection.** The live fetch is compared
 *   against *this branch's* `robots-test.txt`, so a genuine failure has two
 *   other plausible causes worth ruling out first: the local baseline was
 *   edited here but not yet deployed to test.elanregistry.org, or the Test
 *   host's `post-receive` robots.txt swap itself failed/drifted and is now
 *   serving production's file. Both produce the same "foreign group(s)
 *   detected" symptom as a real Cloudflare re-injection.
 *
 * The parser and rule evaluator here are a deliberate, self-contained
 * reimplementation rather than shared code with `RobotsTxtPolicyTest.php`:
 * that test's `findGroup()` returns only the *first* matching group, which
 * would make a second injected group for the same token invisible — the
 * precise failure mode this test exists to detect.
