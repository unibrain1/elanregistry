/**
 * Tests the upload path guard used by save.php::uploadImages().
 *
 * The guard logic lives in ElanRegistry\UploadPathGuard::isWithinTarget()
 * (extracted from save.php per #1601) — a pure, PSR-4-autoloaded method with
 * zero framework dependency, so it loads standalone in the unit tier. The
 * behavioral tests below call it directly, so they exercise the exact same
 * code path production runs — no drift risk. Previously these tests asserted
 * against a hand-copied duplicate of the guard condition declared inside this
 * test class, which could silently diverge from the real guard.
 *
 * The guard must:
 *  (a) accept a direct child directory (dirname strips trailing slash and resolves to parent)
 *  (b) accept a genuine nested subdirectory
 *  (c) reject a sibling directory with a shared prefix
 *  (d) reject when realpath() returns false (missing or misconfigured base directory)
 *
 * Two companion source-inspection tests verify save.php is actually wired to
 * the guard — the one part of the contract that can't be verified
 * behaviorally, since save.php can't be loaded standalone in this tier. One
 * confirms the guard condition itself is called (rather than an inline
 * duplicate); the other confirms the throw beneath it is still present, so a
 * weakened guard that logs but no longer blocks the write is also caught.
 *
