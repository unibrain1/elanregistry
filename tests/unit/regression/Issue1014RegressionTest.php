/**
 * Regression test for Issue #1014: validate to_user_id matches car owner in send-owner-email.php
 *
 * Ensures that the IDOR guard cannot be accidentally removed or restructured in future
 * refactors. Without the ownership check, any authenticated user could send an unsolicited
 * contact email to any registered user by crafting a POST with an arbitrary to_user_id.
 *
 * @issue 1014
 * @link https://github.com/unibrain1/elanregistry/issues/1014
 * @category regression
 *
 * Root cause: send-owner-email.php accepted to_user_id from POST without verifying that
 * the supplied user owns the car referenced by car_id. The car_id hidden field was only
 * consumed for the post-send redirect, never for authorization.
 *
 * Fix: after reading to_user_id and car_id, query cars.user_id for the supplied car_id
 * and reject (with LOG_CATEGORY_ACCESS_DENIED logging) if it does not match to_user_id.
 * Added a prior positive-integer guard that logs and rejects zero or negative IDs.
 * Added a DB-error guard that logs LOG_CATEGORY_DATABASE_ERROR before the ownership
 * comparison to prevent DB failures from being misclassified as IDOR attempts.
