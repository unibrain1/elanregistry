/**
 * Regression guardrail for Issue #1585: DB collaborators are typed as DatabaseInterface
 *
 * Issue #1585 extracted `ElanRegistry\DatabaseInterface` and the thin
 * `ElanRegistry\Database\DbAdapter` wrapper, retyped every production class that
 * takes a database collaborator from the concrete UserSpice `\DB` to the
 * interface, and deleted the shared global mock shell that the unit suite used
 * to declare in `tests/bootstrap-unit.php`.
 *
 * Every part of that fix is invisible to ordinary behavioural tests — a new
 * class typed against the concrete `\DB`, a re-introduced global mock shell, or
 * a call to a `\DB` method that was never added to the interface, would all
 * compile and pass every existing test while quietly restoring the untestable
 * coupling (or the latent runtime fatal) this issue removed. These three static
 * source scans fail CI the moment any of those anti-patterns reappears.

     * call to one of them on an interface-typed collaborator parses fine, passes
     * PHPStan's baseline, and only fatals at runtime when the collaborator really
     * is a `DatabaseInterface` instance. #1585 found exactly this bug class in
     * `app/owner/contact/owner.php` (a call to a `\DB`-only method), which this
     * guardrail exists to catch for interface-typed receivers going forward. That
     * specific file is not itself covered: its `$db` is the ambient page-scope
     * global, which stays a real `\DB` and never imports `DatabaseInterface`, so
     * it falls outside every pattern this test checks — see the scoping note
     * below and `getProductionPhpFiles()`'s docblock. The fix there was a direct
     * code change (the file now calls `\DB::get()`, which real `\DB` has).
     *
     * The canonical method list comes from reflection on the interface, never a
     * hardcoded copy, so adding a method to `DatabaseInterface` automatically
     * widens what this test permits.
     *
     * Precision tradeoff — like the sibling scans, this is a source-text scan, not
     * type inference, so it deliberately trades completeness for zero false
     * positives:
     * - `dbi()->` and `$this->db->` / `$this->_db->` receivers are checked in
     *   every production file; both are interface-typed by construction.
     * - A bare `$db->` is checked only in files that import `DatabaseInterface`
     *   and do not re-assign `$db` from the raw `\DB` singleton. Without that
     *   scoping the ambient UserSpice `$db` global — a real `\DB` in ~80 page and
     *   script files — would produce noise for every legitimate extra-`\DB` call.
     * - Chained calls (`$db->query(...)->results()`) are out of scope; unpicking
     *   nested parentheses with a regex costs more than it protects, and the
     *   chain head is already covered.
     *
     * Verified clean against the codebase by inspection at the time of writing:
     * the scan reaches 353 production files, and the only extra-`\DB` call it
     * declines to flag is `$db->deleteById()` in `app/admin/verify/send_email.php`
     * — a raw ambient-`$db` file that never imports the interface.
