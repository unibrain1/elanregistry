# Test Suite Organization

Elan Registry uses a multi-tier test architecture for comprehensive quality assurance.

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)

**Purpose**: Fast, isolated testing with mocks
**Speed**: < 1 second total
**Database**: None (uses mocks)
**Run**: `composer test:quick` or `composer test:unit`

**Characteristics:**

- Mock CarModel class for model validation
- Mock DB class for database operations
- No UserSpice framework loaded
- Ideal for TDD and rapid feedback

**Example test suites:**

- `CarCoreTest.php` - Car class core methods
- `CarValidatorTest.php` - Input validation (with mock CarModel)
- `FileUploadSecurityTest.php` - Upload security

### Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)

**Purpose**: Real database operations and workflows
**Speed**: < 5 seconds total
**Database**: Required (auto-loads fixtures)
**Run**: `composer test:integration` or `composer test:medium`

**Characteristics:**

- Real CarModel class with car_models table
- Real DB class with MySQL connection
- UserSpice framework loaded
- Auto-loads reference data on first run

**Example test suites:**

- `CarModelTest.php` - CarModel reference data queries
- `CarValidatorModelTest.php` - Model validation with real database
- `FactoryRegistryLinkIntegrationTest.php` - Registry Link feature

### Regression Tests (`tests/regression/`)

**Purpose**: Legacy test suite for backward compatibility
**Speed**: Variable
**Database**: Mock
**Run**: `composer test:regression`

### Browser Tests (`tests/playwright/`)

**Purpose**: End-to-end UI testing
**Speed**: Seconds to minutes
**Database**: Live test environment
**Run**: `npm run playwright:test`

**Specialized suites:**

- `:security` - CSRF, XSS, authentication
- `:navigation` - Menu, breadcrumbs, routing
- `:functionality` - Core features
- `:ui` - Visual consistency

## Database Fixtures

Integration tests require the `car_models` reference table to be populated.

### Automatic Fixture Loading

The `bootstrap-integration.php` automatically loads reference data from
`database/2-reference-data.sql` when the `car_models` table is empty:

```php
// Happens automatically on first integration test run
// Loads 24 car model records into car_models table
```

### Manual Fixture Setup

You can manually run the setup script:

```bash
php tests/setup-test-database.php
```

**Output:**

```text
================================================================================
ELAN REGISTRY TEST DATABASE SETUP
================================================================================

✅ Database connection verified
📊 Current car_models records: 0
📂 Loading reference data from: /path/to/database/2-reference-data.sql
🔄 Loading car_models reference data...
✅ Loaded 24 car_models records successfully

📋 Sample records:
   - Elan 1500|Roadster|26 (Elan 1500)
   - S1|Roadster|26 (Elan 1600)
   - S4|FHC|36 (Coupe S4)
   - Sprint|FHC|36 (Coupe Sprint)
   - +2|FHC|50 (Plus 2)

================================================================================
✅ Test database setup complete.

### Fixture Requirements by Test

| Test Suite | car_models Required | Auto-loads |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tests/unit/` | No (uses mocks) | N/A |
| `tests/integration/Reference/CarModelTest.php` | Yes | ✅ |
| `tests/integration/cars/services/CarValidatorModelTest.php` | Yes | ✅ |
| Other integration tests | No | N/A |

## CI vs. Local Test Runs, and the `known-broken` Group

`.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs `composer test:quick:ci` and `composer test:regression:ci`
(not plain `test:quick`/`test:regression`) for the CI-blocking check on every PR. Each `:ci`
variant is identical to its base command except it adds `--exclude-group known-broken` — both
suites support the exclusion identically, so a tagged test is skipped in CI regardless of
which suite it lives in.

**Why this exists:** landing a new CI gate (`#1437`) should never be blocked indefinitely by
an unrelated, already-tracked, pre-existing bug — but a bypass that's silent or permanent is
worse than no gate at all. The `known-broken` group is the explicit, visible, temporary
escape hatch:

- Tag an affected test method with `#[Group('known-broken')]` **plus** an inline comment
  citing the tracking issue, e.g. `// #1470 — fails on Linux CI, root cause under investigation`.
  **This comment format is load-bearing, not just documentation** — `/finish-milestone`'s
  Step 3.5 greps for the tag and parses the issue number out of that free-text `// #NNN — ...`
  comment to check whether it's still open. A tag added without a `#NNN` reference in that
  exact form will silently defeat that check.
- `composer test:quick`/`composer test:regression` (the default local/dev commands, and each
  `:ci` variant's superset) still run and report these failures — nobody loses visibility locally.
- Only the `:ci` variants (the CI-blocking commands) skip them, and only until the tracking
  issue is resolved and the tag is removed.
- `/finish-milestone` checks for any remaining `known-broken`-tagged tests and asks for
  explicit confirmation before finishing a milestone with known-excluded tests still present
  — this prevents the escape hatch from silently becoming permanent.

Do not use this group for a test you simply don't feel like fixing right now — it exists
specifically for "this genuinely needs investigation, is tracked, and shouldn't block an
unrelated PR" scenarios, discovered in practice when `tests.yml` first ran on a clean Linux
CI checkout and surfaced pre-existing macOS-vs-Linux behavior differences invisible to local
development.

## Writing New Tests

### Unit Test Example

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;
use ElanRegistry\Car\CarValidator;

final class MyValidatorTest extends TestCase
{
    private CarValidator $validator;

    protected function setUp(): void
    {
        $this->validator = new CarValidator();
    }

    public function testValidatesInput(): void
    {
        // Uses mock CarModel automatically
        $result = $this->validator->validateAndSanitizeFields([
            'model' => 'S4|FHC|36', // Valid in mock
        ], false);

        $this->assertArrayHasKey('model', $result);
    }
}
```

### Integration Test Example

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Tests\Integration\Reference;

use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;
use ElanRegistry\Reference\CarModel;

/**
 * @group integration
 * @group reference-data
 */
class MyCarModelTest extends TestCase
{
    private CarModel $carModel;

    protected function setUp(): void
    {
        // Real CarModel with database
        // car_models table auto-populated by bootstrap
        $this->carModel = new CarModel();
    }

    public function testQueriesDatabase(): void
    {
        $models = $this->carModel->getAll();
        $this->assertGreaterThanOrEqual(20, count($models));
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Integration Tests Fail with "car_models table is empty"

**Solution:**

```bash
php tests/setup-test-database.php
```

Or check bootstrap output for fixture loading errors.

### Unit Tests Access Real Database

**Problem**: Unit test is marked `@group integration` but in `tests/unit/`

**Solution**: Move to `tests/integration/` or remove database dependency and use mocks.

### Mock CarModel Doesn't Match Real Data

**Problem**: Unit test fails because mock doesn't have all valid model combinations.

**Solution**: Either:

1. Add the model to mock in `bootstrap-unit.php`
2. Move test to integration suite if real data is required
