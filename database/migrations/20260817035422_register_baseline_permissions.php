/**
 * Establish the three baseline `permissions` rows every ElanRegistry install
 * depends on: `1 = User`, `2 = Administrator`, `3 = Editor`.
 *
 * The vendored structure dump (`database/vendor/userspice-6.1.4-base.sql`) is
 * DDL only — it creates the `permissions` table but inserts no rows, so a
 * freshly provisioned schema starts with none of them. On dev/prod, rows 1
 * and 2 were created by UserSpice's install wizard and row 3 ("Editor", an
 * ElanRegistry-specific tier) by hand, all outside any tracked migration or
 * seed. `scripts/provision-schema.sh` runs neither the wizard nor any manual
 * step, so without this migration a fresh install has an empty table while
 * `PagePermissionClassifier`,
 * `app/admin/scripts/maintenance/21-Fix-Page-Permissions.php`, and
 * `PageRegistrationSeed` all hardcode `permission_id` 2 and 3 as though the
 * rows exist. `PageRegistrationSeed` fails loudly on the missing id rather
 * than writing orphaned `permission_page_matches` rows — that abort is what
 * surfaced this gap.
 *
 * Each `id` is forced explicitly rather than left to AUTO_INCREMENT, because
 * every consumer looks these rows up by literal id, not by name. This is the
 * inverse of the noowner account (see `RegisterNoownerAccount`), which
 * deliberately lets its id fall to AUTO_INCREMENT precisely because it is
 * resolved by username.
 *
 * Converted from `database/seeds/BaselinePermissionsSeed.php` (removed) to a
 * migration: this row is part of the registry's base configuration and
 * should never need to be replayed. As a migration it also structurally
 * guarantees ordering ahead of `PageRegistrationSeed` — migrations always
 * run before seeds — replacing the previous alphabetical-filename ordering
 * trick the seed relied on (`provision-schema.sh` enumerates
 * `database/seeds/*.php` in filesystem order; the class was deliberately
 * named to sort ahead of `PageRegistrationSeed`).
 *
 * Idempotent per row: an id that already exists is left exactly as-is. Names
 * and descriptions are deliberately NOT forced to match — an environment that
 * renamed a role did so on purpose, and every consumer keys off the id, not
 * the name. Only a missing row is a defect worth correcting.
 *
 * down() deletes only the rows it would have inserted, and only when no user
 * still holds that permission — dropping a referenced row would leave users
 * pointing at a permission that no longer exists.
