# Finish Issue

## Step 0: Initialize TaskList

Before any other action, create one tracking task per major step below using
TaskCreate. Set to `in_progress` when starting each, `completed` on success.
This is a CI-polling workflow that can take 10+ minutes — visible progress
matters.

Monitor a PR's CI checks, then squash-merge into the milestone branch, close
the issue, delete the branch, and return to the milestone branch.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` — the GitHub issue number (e.g., `423`). If omitted, infer
  from the current branch name (e.g., `issue/423-car-data-export` → `423`,
  `bug/512-negative-price` → `512`, `feature/423-export` → `423`).

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine the issue number and PR

If no argument is provided, extract the issue number from the current branch
name:

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

The branch must match `issue/<number>-*`, `bug/<number>-*`, or
`feature/<number>-*`. If it doesn't, stop and ask the user for the issue
number.

Find the open PR for this issue branch:

```bash
gh pr list --head "$(git branch --show-current)" --state open \
  --json number,title,url,baseRefName,statusCheckRollup
```

If no PR exists, stop and tell the user to run `/commit-push-pr` first.

### Step 2: Identify the target (base) branch

The PR's `baseRefName` should be a `milestone/*` branch. Record it — this is
where we'll return after merging.

If the PR targets `main` instead of a milestone branch, **warn the user** —
issue PRs should always target the milestone branch per the git workflow. Ask
if they want to proceed or retarget the PR.

### Step 2.5: Handle draft PRs — trigger review, then mark ready

Check if the PR is a draft:

```bash
gh pr view <pr-number> --json isDraft --repo elan-registry/registry -q .isDraft
```

**If the PR is a draft:**

1. Trigger the Claude Code Review workflow on the draft PR before notifying
   anyone:

   ```bash
   gh workflow run claude-code-review.yml \
     --ref main \
     --field pr_number=<pr-number> \
     --repo elan-registry/registry
   ```

2. Wait for the workflow run to complete. Poll every 30 seconds:

   ```bash
   # Get the most recent run of claude-code-review.yml
   gh run list --workflow=claude-code-review.yml --limit=1 \
     --repo elan-registry/registry --json databaseId,status,conclusion
   gh run watch <run-id> --repo elan-registry/registry
   ```

3. Report the review result. If the review posted **Blocking** findings, stop
   here and tell the user to fix them before proceeding.

4. Once the review is clean (no Blocking items), mark the PR as ready. This
   is the moment watchers are notified — immediately followed by merge:

   ```bash
   gh pr ready <pr-number> --repo elan-registry/registry
   ```

**If the PR is already ready (not a draft):** skip to Step 3 — the Claude
review already ran when the PR was pushed.

### Step 3: Monitor CI checks

Poll the PR's check status until all checks complete (pass or fail):

```bash
gh pr checks <pr-number> --watch --fail-fast
```

If `--watch` is not available, poll manually:

```bash
gh pr checks <pr-number>
```

Wait 30 seconds between polls. Maximum 20 attempts (10 minutes). If checks
are still pending after 10 minutes, report status and ask the user whether to
keep waiting.

**Expected CI checks** (see DEPLOYMENT.md for details):

- CodeQL Analysis — security scanning
- GitGuardian Security — secret detection
- Claude Code Review — coding standards
- PHPUnit Unit + Regression — behavioral test suite (`tests.yml`, added in #1437; not yet a
  GitHub-required check, so `gh pr checks` is what actually surfaces its status here — this
  step's polling already does that regardless of this list)

### Step 4: Handle check results

**If all checks pass** → report results to the user and **ask for explicit
confirmation before merging**: "All CI checks passed. Ready to squash-merge
PR #NNN into `MILESTONE_BRANCH` and close issue #NNN. Shall I proceed?"
Do NOT merge until the user confirms.

**If any check fails:**

- List which checks failed
- For each failed check, fetch the logs:

  ```bash
  gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
  ```

- Analyze the failure logs and report:
  - Which check failed and why
  - The relevant error messages
  - A suggested fix or next step
- **Stop here.** Do not merge. Tell the user to fix the issue, push the fix,
  and re-run `/finish-issue` when ready.

### Step 5: Squash-merge the PR

```bash
gh pr merge <pr-number> --squash --delete-branch
```

This squash-merges into the milestone branch and deletes the issue branch
(both local and remote).

### Step 6: Close the GitHub issue

```bash
gh issue close $ARGUMENTS --comment "Resolved via PR #<pr-number>."
```

Remove the "in progress" label if present:

```bash
gh issue edit $ARGUMENTS --remove-label "in progress"
```

### Step 7: Update draft release notes

Read the draft release notes at
`docs/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v<version>.md` (where `<version>` is extracted
from the milestone branch name, e.g., `milestone/v2.17.0` → `v2.17.0`).

In the "Issues Resolved" section, mark this issue as resolved (remove any
"WIP:" prefix if present).

If the release notes were updated, commit the change:

```bash
git add docs/releases/
git commit -m "docs: mark issue #$ARGUMENTS as resolved in release notes"
```

### Step 8: Return to the milestone branch

```bash
git checkout <milestone-branch>
git pull origin <milestone-branch>
```

Clean up the local issue branch if it still exists:

```bash
git branch -d <issue-branch> 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 9: Report results

Output a summary:

- Issue #`<number>` — closed
- PR #`<pr-number>` — squash-merged into `<milestone-branch>`
- Branch `<issue-branch>` — deleted
- Release notes updated at `docs/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v<version>.md`
- Now on `<milestone-branch>`

List remaining open issues in the milestone. Use the direct API (`gh issue list --milestone` can silently return empty results):

```bash
# Get milestone number from the milestone branch name, then query API directly
MILESTONE_TITLE=$(git branch --show-current | sed 's|.*milestone/||' || echo "<milestone title>")
MILESTONE_NUM=$(gh api "repos/elan-registry/registry/milestones" \
  --jq ".[] | select(.title | startswith(\"${MILESTONE_TITLE}\")) | .number")
gh api "repos/elan-registry/registry/issues?milestone=${MILESTONE_NUM}&state=open&per_page=20" \
  --jq '.[] | {number, title}'
```

Suggest next steps:

- If open issues remain: "Run `/start-issue <next-issue>` to begin the next
  issue in this milestone"
- If no open issues remain: "All issues in this milestone are complete. Run
  `/finish-milestone $ARGUMENTS` to create the milestone PR"

## Important

- **Never force-merge if checks are failing.** Always investigate and report
  first.
- The squash merge keeps the milestone branch history clean — one commit per
  issue.
- If the PR targets `main` instead of a milestone branch, warn the user.
  Issue PRs should always target the milestone branch.
- If the local branch can't be deleted (e.g., you're still on it), switch to
  the milestone branch first.
- This command closes the issue directly. The `Closes #NNN` keyword in the
  milestone PR body (created by `/finish-milestone`) serves as a backup for
  any issues that weren't closed here.
