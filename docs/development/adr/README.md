# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Lotus Elan
Registry. ADRs document significant architectural decisions, their context, and
consequences.

We follow the [Michael Nygard ADR template](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
