# Coding Standards for Elan Registry

**Updated:** September 7, 2025 | **Target:** PHP 8.2+

---

## PHP 8+ Requirements

All new files require `declare(strict_types=1)`, full type hints on all parameters/returns/properties, typed exceptions, and PHPDoc on all public methods.

### Strict Type Safety with Database Values

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: When using `declare(strict_types=1)`, database INTEGER columns may be returned as strings depending on PHP/MySQL configuration.

**Always cast database values explicitly when passing to strict-typed parameters:**

```php
// ✅ CORRECT - Explicit type casting
$backupManager = new BackupManager($db, $backupDir, (int)$user->data()->id);
$carId = (int)$dbRow->id;
$count = (int)$result->first()->total;

// ❌ WRONG - Missing cast in strict mode
$backupManager = new BackupManager($db, $backupDir, $user->data()->id);
// TypeError: Argument #3 ($userId) must be of type ?int, string given
```

**Common casts:**

```php
$userId = (int)$user->data()->id;   // integer columns
$isActive = (bool)$row->active;     // TINYINT boolean
$optionalId = $row->optional_id ? (int)$row->optional_id : null;
```

**Type helper functions** (preferred for object properties):

```php
$userId = dbInt($carData, 'user_id');  // throws on invalid input
$adminId = currentUserId();            // throws RuntimeException if not logged in
```

Defined in `usersc/includes/custom_functions.php`. Use `dbInt()` for PDO result objects; use `(int)` for simple scalars.

**Why**: PDO returns INT columns as strings on PHP 8.2/test but as int on PHP 8.3/dev. With strict types, `string ≠ int` — always cast explicitly.

**See also:** `/docs/development/STRICT_TYPE_HANDLING.md` for comprehensive strategy.

## Code Architecture

### Exception Handling

All exceptions extend `ElanRegistryException` (26 domain types). Never throw generic `Exception`. Each carries
an HTTP status code, log category, and separate technical/user-facing messages.
See [ERROR_HANDLING.md](ERROR_HANDLING.md#exception-hierarchy).

- All AJAX endpoints **MUST** use `ApiResponse` — factory methods: `success()`, `error()`, `validationError()`,
  `unauthorized()`, `forbidden()`, `notFound()`, `serverError()`. See [ERROR_HANDLING.md](ERROR_HANDLING.md#backend-error-handling).
- All `logger()` calls **MUST** use `LogCategories` constants (never hardcoded strings).
  Discover: `grep "const LOG_CATEGORY" usersc/classes/LogCategories.php`

### Method Naming

- **Verbs**: `create()`, `update()`, `delete()`, `validate()`
- **Boolean methods**: `exists()`, `isValid()`, `hasPermission()`
- **Getters**: `data()`, `images()`, `history()` (not `getData()`)

---

## Security Standards

### Input Handling and Output Encoding

Store plain text via `Input::raw()`; escape at the **output** context (templates, email).

```php
// ✅ CORRECT — plain text in DB, escaped at render time
<?= htmlspecialchars($car->color, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8') ?>

// ❌ WRONG — encodes at storage (double-encoding bug)
$color = \Input::get('color');
$cardetails['color'] = htmlspecialchars($color, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
```

**Rules:**

- `Input::raw()` (via `use ElanRegistry\Input`) → values going to the database
- `Input::existsPost()` / `Input::existsGet()` → POST/GET presence checks in files that import
  `ElanRegistry\Input` — `ElanRegistry\Input::exists()` was removed in v2.26.1
- `\Input::get()` → legacy pattern only (value used directly in HTML, no further escaping)
- `htmlspecialchars()` → always at output (HTML templates, email templates)
- Parameterised queries handle SQL safety; encoding at storage is never a SQL defence
- `Input::raw()` second parameter is a **trim flag** (`bool $trim`), not a default value — use `Input::raw('field') ?? 'fallback'` to supply a default

### Database Operations

Always use parameterized queries — never string concatenation:

```php
// ✅ Parameterized
$query = $this->db->query('SELECT * FROM cars WHERE chassis = ? LIMIT 1', [$chassis]);

// ❌ Never do this
$query = "SELECT * FROM cars WHERE chassis = '{$chassis}'";
```

### CSRF Protection

All forms require a CSRF token. Validate with `Token::check(Input::get('csrf'))` before processing POST data.

### Error Logging Standards

All error conditions in web context **MUST** use `logger()` — never `error_log()`.
Use `$user->data()->id ?? 0` for the user ID. `error_log()` is allowed in CLI scripts only.

```php
logger($user->data()->id ?? 0, LogCategories::LOG_CATEGORY_SYSTEM_ERROR, 'Operation failed: ' . $e->getMessage());
```

All `logger()` calls **MUST** use `LogCategories` constants — never hardcoded strings. Discover available constants: `grep "const LOG_CATEGORY" usersc/classes/LogCategories.php`

---

## Documentation Standards

PHPDoc required on all classes and public methods: class summary, `@param`, `@return`, `@throws`.
Comments on complex logic only — never explain what the code obviously does.

---

## File Organization

### File Naming

- **Classes**: `PascalCase` — `Car.php`, `CarValidationException.php`, one class per file
- **Scripts/pages**: `snake_case` — `edit_car.php`, `send_email.php`
- **Partials**: `_partial-name.php`

See [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) for directory structure.

## PHPStan Baseline Hygiene

The project runs a single `phpstan.neon` config at level 5. It analyses an
explicit list of project-owned paths (see the `paths` block in the config);
`users/` upstream and `tests/` are out of scope. Pre-existing errors are
captured in `phpstan-baseline.neon`.

**When you touch any project-owned PHP file:** run PHPStan on it and fix
**all** errors it reports. The baseline silently suppresses pre-existing errors,
so anything PHPStan reports is new. Then regenerate the baseline to drop the
entries you resolved.

```bash
# Check the file you modified
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse app/api/cars/save.php

# After fixing, remove the resolved baseline entries
composer phpstan:baseline
```

`reportUnmatchedIgnoredErrors: true` enforces this mechanically: if you fix an
error but leave its baseline entry, CI fails. The only safe path is to fix the
error and regenerate.

Note: pre-commit (`.githooks/pre-commit`) already runs a full-repo
`phpstan analyse` on every commit that stages a PHP file — the single-file
command above is for your tighter inner dev loop while actively fixing a
file, not a substitute for what the hook does at commit time.

The goal is to reduce the baseline over time. Target: below 100 entries → upgrade
to level 8 (nullable property/method access checks).

## Issue & PR Title Conventions

Issue and PR titles use a Conventional-Commits-style preamble (`type: description`).
This matters beyond the tracker: squash-merged PR titles become the commit
message on `main` (see `/finish-issue`), so the preamble is what makes `git log`
scannable by change type.

### Preamble types

| Preamble | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `fix:` | A defect with a scoped, concrete corrective action already defined (acceptance criteria present) |
| `bug:` | A defect that has been found/reported but **not yet scoped** — pairs with the `triage` label, no acceptance criteria yet |
| `feat:` | New user-facing functionality |
| `test:` | The deliverable is test coverage/test-suite work, even when it addresses a bug (see below) |
| `chore:` | Maintenance work with no user-facing behavior change |
| `docs:` | Documentation-only changes |
| `refactor:` | Restructuring without behavior change |
| `tech-debt:` | Debt-reduction work tracked as such |
| `security:` | Security-motivated change (when not simply `fix:`) |
| `seo:` | Search/crawler-visibility changes |

`fix:` vs `bug:` is the pair that's easy to get backwards: `bug:` describes
*the problem*, `fix:` describes *the scoped solution*. An issue graduates from
`bug:` to `fix:` once someone has written concrete acceptance criteria for it
— which is usually also when the `triage` label comes off.

The preamble can legitimately differ from the primary label — e.g. a `test:`
preamble with a `bug` label is correct when the deliverable is a test fix for
an underlying defect (the label says what's wrong, the preamble says what
you're shipping).

### Preamble vs. labels

Labels (GitHub's structured, multi-select metadata) classify orthogonal
facets: `component: *` (area), workflow state (`triage`, `in progress`,
`waiting: *`), and defect/debt classification (`bug`, `tech-debt`, `security`,
`enhancement`). The preamble is a single value describing the change's primary
verb for git history. Don't force them to match — a `test:`-preambled issue
can correctly carry a `bug` label, and a `fix:`-preambled issue rarely needs
`triage` since it's already scoped.

### Where this is enforced

- `/new-issue` always drafts a fully-scoped issue (acceptance criteria +
  technical notes) before creating it, so its titles use a scoped type
  (`fix:`, `feat:`, `test:`, etc.) — never bare `bug:`.
- `/found` creates issues from a one-line description with no acceptance
  criteria, so its titles use `bug:` (or the closest matching type for a
  non-defect finding) and keep the `triage` label until someone scopes it.
