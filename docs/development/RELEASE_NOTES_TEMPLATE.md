## Template Instructions

**Delete everything below the `---` line when creating actual release notes.**

### Working Draft Convention

`docs/releases/` holds **only the current milestone's working draft**. Once
`/release-milestone` publishes the notes to GitHub Releases, the file is
deleted from the repo. GitHub Releases is the canonical archive — do not
accumulate historical files here.

### For AI Agents

When generating release notes:

1. **Gather all changes** from the milestone: closed issues, merged PRs, and
   commits since the last release tag.
2. **User-Facing Changes** are changes visible to public registry visitors
   (car listings, owner pages, search, etc.). **Admin-Facing Changes** are
   changes visible only to administrators (admin dashboard, maintenance tools,
   settings). Keep these sections separate. Each item is one line, benefit-focused.
   Remove a section or subsection entirely if it has no entries.
3. **Issues Resolved** lists every closed issue in the milestone, sorted by
   issue number. Use the exact GitHub issue/PR title verbatim.
   Format: `- [#NNN](URL) — GitHub issue title`. This describes the
   *finished* release notes — `/finish-milestone` verifies every entry
   matches this format before opening the milestone PR. Mid-milestone, entries
   for issues not yet completed carry a `WIP:` prefix
   (`- WIP: [#NNN](URL) — GitHub issue title`), added by `/start-milestone`
   when it pre-populates the section and removed by `/finish-issue` once that
   issue's PR merges — every entry must have that prefix stripped by the time
   `/finish-milestone` runs.
4. **Required Actions** should only appear when there are actual post-deployment
   steps (SQL migrations, config changes, dependency installs). Otherwise state
   "None".
5. **Be concise.** No multi-line descriptions. One line per entry. The Issues
   Resolved list carries the narrative — link to the issue/PR for details.
6. **No emoji** in section headers.
