#### 🚀 START HERE

New to the project? Four documents, in this order:

1. **[SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md](development/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md)** — what the registry does, who can do what, and what is deliberately not built
2. **[Registry Installation Guide][install-wiki]** — get it running
3. **[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)** — conventions, commands, development workflow
4. **[CODING_STANDARDS.md](development/CODING_STANDARDS.md)** — how to write code here

`CLAUDE.md` is the canonical entry point; this index and the wiki both defer to
its ordering.
