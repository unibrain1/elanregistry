/**
 * PHPStan bootstrap — pre-declares UserSpice framework globals so the
 * `require_once config.php` at the bottom of this file can resolve
 * `$abs_us_root` and `$us_url_root` during analysis startup.
 *
 * These globals are set by z_us_root.php + users/init.php +
 * usersc/includes/server_globals.php at runtime, but PHPStan bootstraps in
 * isolation. The remaining stubs (server_globals globals, $user, $db) are
 * declared for consistency and IDE completeness.
 *
 * Note: these stubs do NOT suppress variable.undefined errors in page files —
 * bootstrap scope is isolated from the analysed files. That suppression is
 * handled by the ignoreErrors pattern in phpstan.neon.
 *
 * Page-level variables ($car, $transfer, $settings, etc.) are script-scope
 * locals set via includes and are handled by the generated baseline instead.
