#
# Provisions a database schema from scratch, with no live source database:
#
#   1. DROP + CREATE the target schema
#   2. Apply the vendored stock UserSpice structure
#      (database/vendor/userspice-6.1.4-base.sql)
#   3. composer migrate  — the ElanRegistry baseline migration + deltas
#   4. phinx seed:run    — reference/config data
#
# Nothing here reads any source database, and no binary path is hardcoded —
# `mysql`/`mysqldump` resolve via $PATH (overridable, see below) — so the same
# script works on a developer machine and in CI.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/provision-schema.sh [options]
#
# Options:
#   --env-file <path>  Env file holding the TARGET database credentials.
#                      Default: .env.test.local (override also via
#                      PROVISION_ENV_FILE).
#   --full             Run every seed, including ElanFactoryInfoSeed (9,762 rows
#                      of factory data). Use for a real install; the default
#                      test/CI provisioning skips it — tests don't need it and
#                      it dominates the run time.
#   --skip-seeds       Provision structure only (vendor base + migrations).
#   --force            Override the schema-name safety guards (see below).

# Environment overrides:
#   MYSQL_BIN          Path to the `mysql` client. Defaults to `mysql` resolved

# --- Safety guards -----------------------------------------------------------
# The one destructive operation here is DROP DATABASE on the target. The old

# there is no source database any more, so that comparison is gone. What still
# needs protecting is the same thing it was protecting: a misconfigured env file
# pointing this script at a real dev/prod database.
#
# Two guards replace it, both overridable with --force because this script is
# also the supported way to provision a fresh dev or CI database (where a
# non-"test" name is the correct answer):
#
#   1. Refuse a target name that doesn't look like a test schema. Names are
#      case-folded — MAMP's MySQL runs with lower_case_table_names=2 on macOS's
#      case-insensitive filesystem, so a typo'd-case name would otherwise slip
#      past a naive comparison.
#   2. Refuse the database this checkout's application is configured to use
#      (DB_NAME in .env.local, else .env), which is the specific accident the
#      old guard existed to prevent.
