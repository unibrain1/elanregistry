The Lotus Elan Registry

This is code for the Lotus Elan Registry  hosted at https://elanregistry.org.  This is used in conjunction with Userspice (https://userspice.com) to build an online database for Lotus Elan and Lotus Elan +2 cars.

This is the Registry for the 1963 thru 1973 Lotus Elan and the 1967 thru 1974 Lotus Elan Plus 2. The purpose of the registry is to keep a history of the cars, trace the evolution of the Lotus Elan and to facilitate owner communication.

Some History on the Registry
-----------------------------
The Lotus Elan Registry started in January 2003. A thread on LotusElan.net asked the question, Does anybody know if there is a Lotus Elan register? (http://www.lotuselan.net/forums/lotus-elan-f19/lotus-elan-register-t349.html) I bashed together a registry and a few years later we have over 300 cars accounted for with more added every month.  That was Version 1 and has some very serious pitfalls.  


Many people on the Elan mailing list and the Elan forums have helped with the registry. Little things like asking for there to be a registry, helping test, providing pictures and feedback on what should be included. This is their work. I am just the one who assembled the pieces.

Special thanks to Ross, Tim, Gary, Ed, Terry, Peter, Jeff, Nicholas, Alan, Christian, Michael, Stan, Jason and everyone else who has contributed and will continue to make the registry what it is. A place for us to obsess over little British cars.
