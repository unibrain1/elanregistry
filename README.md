# The Lotus Elan Registry

A comprehensive online database for Lotus Elan and Lotus Elan +2 cars, hosted at [elanregistry.org](https://elanregistry.org).

This registry covers the 1963-1973 Lotus Elan and 1967-1974 Lotus Elan +2, serving to preserve automotive history, trace the evolution of these iconic British sports cars, and facilitate communication between owners worldwide.

## History

The Lotus Elan Registry began in January 2003 following a discussion on LotusElan.net asking "Does anybody know if there is a Lotus Elan register?" Starting with basic functionality, the registry has evolved into a comprehensive platform serving the global Elan community.

The registry represents the collaborative effort of many enthusiasts from the Elan mailing list and forums, who contributed testing, feedback, images, and suggestions that shaped the platform into what it is today.

**Special thanks** to Ross, Tim, Gary, Ed, Terry, Peter, Jeff, Nicholas, Alan, Christian, Michael, Stan, Jason, and everyone else who has contributed to making this registry a place for enthusiasts to celebrate these remarkable British sports cars.
