# The Lotus Elan Registry

An online database for Lotus Elan and Lotus Elan +2 cars, hosted at
[elanregistry.org](https://elanregistry.org).

This registry covers the 1963–1973 Lotus Elan and 1967–1974 Lotus Elan +2,
serving to preserve automotive history, trace the evolution of these British
sports cars, and facilitate communication between owners worldwide.

## Tech Stack

## Developer Setup

### Requirements

- PHP 8.2+, MySQL 8.0+, Composer, Node.js
- Google Maps API Key (map display + geocoding)
- Cloudflare Turnstile Keys (spam protection)
- Brevo API Key or SMTP config (email delivery)
- UserSpice 6 installed — [userspice.com](https://userspice.com)

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elan-registry/registry.git
composer install
npm install
./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh   # installs pre-commit quality checks
cp .env.example .env            # then fill in credentials
composer test:quick             # verify environment

## Documentation

**New here?** Read [`docs/development/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`](docs/development/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md)
first — what the registry does, who can do what, and what is deliberately not
built. Then [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for conventions and workflow.

| Audience | Where |
| --- | --- |
| **What the system does, by role** | [`docs/development/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`](docs/development/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md) |
| Development conventions, workflow, AI context | [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) |
| Technical reference docs | [`docs/development/`](docs/development/) |
| Concepts and onboarding narrative | [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/elan-registry/registry/wiki) |
| End-user guides | [`docs/guides/`](docs/guides/) |
| Reference pages (paint colors, chassis ID) | [`docs/reference/`](docs/reference/) |

Documentation is split by whether a code change can falsify it: anything that
can lives in this repository, updated in the same pull request; the wiki holds
concepts and installation-from-zero.

## History

The Lotus Elan Registry began in January 2003 following a discussion on
LotusElan.net asking "Does anybody know if there is a Lotus Elan register?"
Starting with basic functionality, the registry has evolved into a platform
serving the global Elan community.

**Special thanks** to Ross, Tim, Gary, Ed, Terry, Peter, Jeff, Nicholas, Alan,
Christian, Michael, Stan, Jason, and everyone else who contributed testing,
feedback, images, and suggestions over the years.
